## Gameplay
In this game, tThe player must battle their way through hordes of enemies, explore new areas, and complete quests in order to progress through the game. The game features a robust combat system that allows players to use a variety of weapons and abilities (EVEN CHARACTERS!) to defeat their foes. In addition to combat, there are also events and dialogues that help to flesh out the game's story and characters.

## Artwork
The artwork for this game was generated using AI. This allowed us to create a unique visual style for the game that would have been impossible to achieve using traditional methods. The AI-generated artwork gives the game a distinct look and feel that sets it apart from other ARPGs.

# How to Play

You can also check the build folder for a mac build.

# Motivation
This game was created with love and dedication as an anniversary gift for my partner. I wanted to make something special and personalized to celebrate our anniversary and share my passion for video games with her.

Throughout the development process, this game became more than just a gift. It was an opportunity to learn and improve my programming and game design skills. Every time I was able to overcome an obstacle or add a new feature to the game, I felt more motivated to keep working on it.

Additionally, the idea of my partner being able to play the game and enjoy it was a great motivation for me. I wanted to make something that would surprise her and make her feel special on our anniversary. And knowing that this game will bring her joy and fun is the best reward I could ask for.

In summary, this game is more than just a game development project. It is a gift of love and an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
